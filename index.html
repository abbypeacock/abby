        <h3>Etiquette &amp; what to expect</h3>
        <p>Please come freshly showered. Hygiene is important to me.</p>

        <p>I will cheerfully welcome you at the door with a hug, as if we are familiar friends. Please place my donation in an envelope or a card where i can clearly see it, and excuse yourself while i collect your gift. Once that is taken care of, our session can begin. We can unwind with a drink or casual conversation. We will spend some time talking and getting to know each other. I'm very affectionate and easy going. My sessions "go with the flow". Non-scripted authentic, soft and sensual connection is what I like to provide. After talking a bit we can move into the bedroom for more intimate time together.  I desire to make you feel totally comfortable during the session. Please let me know your likes and dislikes. I'm a giver and I love to please. While I do not watch a clock, I do take pride in being punctual... so if needed, I will let you know when we need to wrap things up.</p>
